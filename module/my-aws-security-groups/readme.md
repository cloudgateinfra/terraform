This code is written in the Terraform language and is used to manage infrastructure resources on AWS. The code declares two AWS security group rules that allow inbound traffic to instances in the VPC with the tag "hub" from a specific IP address. The first security group rule allows inbound traffic to the security group with the ID sg-111111 on all ports from the IP address 10.111.0.111. The second security group rule allows inbound traffic to the security group with the ID sg-222222 on all ports from the same IP address. These rules allow remote access to instances in the specified security groups from the specified IP address. The code also declares a data source for an AWS VPC with the tag "hub", which is used by the security group rules.
