This code is written in the Terraform language and is used to manage infrastructure resources on AWS. The code declares several AWS autoscaling groups (ASGs) that are used to run instances in a VPC with the tag "prod". The code sets the desired capacity of each ASG to a value specified in the locals block, which is used to control the number of instances in each ASG. This allows the code to be used to refresh the instances in the ASGs by scaling the number of instances up and down. The ASGs use launch templates to specify the AMI to use for the instances and the instances are tagged with several metadata tags. The code also declares a data source for an AWS VPC with the tag "prod". This VPC is used by the ASGs.
