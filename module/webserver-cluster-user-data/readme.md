This Terraform code defines a web server cluster on AWS. Terraform is a tool for building, changing, and versioning infrastructure safely and efficiently. This code is written in HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL) and defines the required version of Terraform and the provider (in this case, AWS) that is needed for this code. It also defines default VPC and subnet values, sets some local variables, creates an AWS security group for the cluster's application load balancer (ALB), and defines rules for the security group. It also creates a launch configuration for instances in the cluster, an autoscaling group for the cluster, and a load balancer and target group for the cluster.
