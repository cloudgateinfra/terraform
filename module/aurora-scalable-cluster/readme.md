This Terraform code creates an Aurora MySQL database cluster on AWS. It specifies the required version of Terraform and the AWS provider. It also creates a cluster and one or more instances within that cluster. The cluster and instances use the specified engine and engine version, and have certain configuration settings, such as a preferred backup window and database name, username, and password. The code also specifies a scaling configuration for the cluster, allowing it to automatically scale up or down based on load.
