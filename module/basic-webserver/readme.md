This Terraform code creates an EC2 instance on AWS and assigns it a security group. The instance is launched with a specified Amazon Machine Image (AMI) and instance type, and is located in the specified region. The code also specifies a bash script as user data for the instance, which is executed when the instance is launched. This script runs a web server on the instance using busybox, and outputs a message to an HTML file. The security group is configured to allow incoming traffic on the specified port from all IP addresses.
